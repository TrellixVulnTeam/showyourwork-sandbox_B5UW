Quickstart
==========

Follow the steps below to start a new open source article project with ``showyourwork``.
If you already have an existing repository that you'd like to use, please check out the
:doc:`faqs`.

.. note::

    This quickstart tutorial assumes you have a basic familiarity with Git, GitHub,
    and LaTeX. If you're not familiar with any of these, check out these
    introductory resources first:

1. Create a new repo
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
       Click <a href="https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork-template/generate">here</a>
       to generate a fresh GitHub repository from the
       <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">showyourwork</span></code>
       template. You'll be prompted for a repository name, and optionally a description.
    </p>

    <div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 17.25px;">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodluger/showyourwork/img/repo-from-template.png" width="75%"/>
    </div>

    <p>
       GitHub will create a new repository based on
       <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">showyourwork-template</span></code>.
       This should only take a few seconds.
    </p>

    <div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 17.25px;">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodluger/showyourwork/img/generating.png" width="25%"/>
    </div>

    <p>
        Once you're repository is created, it should look something like this:
    </p>

    <div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 17.25px;">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodluger/showyourwork/img/fresh-repo.png" width="75%"/>
    </div>

    <p>
        If you click on the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodluger/showyourwork/img/Actions.png" width="60px"/>
        tab at the top of the page, you'll see that there's a GitHub action called
        <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">article</span></code>
        currently running. This action runs every time a new commit is pushed to the repository to re-compile the article PDF.
        The first time it runs, it also does a bit of automatic formatting of the repo, including a re-write of the
        <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code>
        file, so please wait to make edits to your repo until then. The first time the action runs, it needs to download
        and install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">conda</a> and all the dependencies, so it usually
        takes about five minutes.
    </p>


2. Edit the manuscript online
-----------------------------


.. raw:: html

    <p>
       After about five minutes, refresh the main page of your repository. If the action is done running,
       you should see a new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code>
       with badges at the top:
    </p>

    <div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 17.25px;">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodluger/showyourwork/img/banner.png" width="50%"/>
    </div>

    <p>
       Your repository is now set up, and your article has been compiled into a PDF.
       Click on the badge on the far right (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">article pdf</span></code>)
       to download it. There shouldn't be much in the pdf:
    </p>

    <div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 17.25px;">
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodluger/showyourwork/img/article-abstract.png" width="75%"/>
    </div>

    Navigate to the LaTeX manuscript file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/ms.tex</span></code>
    on GitHub and click on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Edit this file</span></code> button
    (the pencil icon at the top right of the file). Change the title and author name to whatever you'd like, and commit your changes
    directly to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> branch.
    If you click again on the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodluger/showyourwork/img/Actions.png" width="60px"/> tab,
    you'll see that your commit triggered another article build. This one should run much faster, since everything is cached across
    builds. When the action is done running, download your PDF once more and verify that your changes were incorporated.


3. Clone the repository
-----------------------

Editing stuff online is useful for quick changes and easy fixes, but you'll probably want to do most of your
development locally. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory of your choice, and clone your new repository
by running

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<user>/<repo>

where ``<user>`` is your GitHub user name and ``<repo>`` is the name of your repository. Note the use of the
option ``recurse-submodules``: this is necessary because the ``showyourwork`` package is included in your
repository as a `Git submodule <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_.

Edit the manuscript (``src/ms.tex``) by replacing the \verb+\blindtext+ command in the abstract with a blurb about your project.
After you make these edits, add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    git add src/ms.tex
    git commit -m "Minor edits to the manuscript"
    git push

Navigate to your repository on GitHub, and once again click on the Actions tab to verify that your article
is building. Within a few minutes you should have an updated, fully synced PDF of your article.


4. Add a figure
---------------

Figures can be included in the article by adding a Python script to the folder ``src/figures``.
Create a script called ``mandelbrot.py`` in that directory and add the following code to it:

.. code-block:: python

    """
    Plot a pretty fractal. Adapted from
    https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/auto_examples/plot_mandelbrot.html
    """
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from numpy import newaxis
    import copy

    def compute_mandelbrot(N_max, some_threshold, nx, ny):
        x = np.linspace(-2, 1, nx)
        y = np.linspace(-1.5, 1.5, ny)
        c = x[:, newaxis] + 1j * y[newaxis, :]
        z = c
        with np.warnings.catch_warnings():
            np.warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
            for j in range(N_max):
                z = z ** 2 + c
            mandelbrot_set = abs(z) < some_threshold
        return mandelbrot_set

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
    mandelbrot_set = np.round(1 - compute_mandelbrot(500, 50.0, 601, 401))
    tab10 = copy.copy(plt.get_cmap("tab10"))
    tab10.set_over("w")
    plt.imshow(
        mandelbrot_set.T,
        extent=[-2, 1, -1.5, 1.5],
        interpolation="nearest",
        cmap=tab10,
        vmin=0,
        vmax=0.9,
    )
    plt.gca().axis("off")
    fig.savefig("mandelbrot.pdf", bbox_inches="tight")

In the TeX file (``src/ms.tex``), include this figure within a ``figure`` environment:

.. code-block:: latex

    \begin{figure}
        \begin{centering}
            \includegraphics{figures/mandelbrot.pdf}
            \caption{The Mandelbrot set.}
            \label{fig:mandelbrot}
        \end{centering}
    \end{figure}

The figure label (``fig:mandelbrot``) tells ``showyourwork`` to look for a script
called ``mandelbrot.py`` to produce the PDF for this particular figure. No extra
directions from the user are needed!

Now add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    git add src/figures/mandelbrot.py
    git add src/ms.tex
    git commit -m "Add a figure"
    git push

Navigate to your repository on GitHub, and once again click on the Actions tab to verify that your article
is building. Within a few minutes you should have an updated, fully synced PDF of your article with the new
rendered figure.


5. Build the repository locally
-------------------------------

It's also useful to be able to build your article PDF locally. To do this, you must have the
``conda`` package manager installed; click
`here <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_ if you don't already have it.
Once ``conda`` is set up, install ``mamba`` and ``snakemake``:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -y -c defaults -c conda-forge -c bioconda mamba snakemake

You now have everything you need to build your article locally. Since ``showyourwork``
is at its core just a ``snakemake`` workflow, you can build your article by running

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake -c1 --use-conda ms.pdf

which tells ``snakemake`` to generate the file ``ms.pdf`` (your article PDF) using
a single core (that's the ``c1`` option) and inside a ``conda`` environment.

The output file ``ms.pdf`` will be placed at the root of your repository; it should
look very similar to the one generated by the GitHub Action. Note that by default,
the various ``.gitignore`` files in your repository prevent you from committing this
and other output files. Remember the basic philosophy behind ``showyourwork``: the
``main`` branch of your article repository should only contain *inputs*. All output
should either be generated on the fly or saved temporarily on the ``main-pdf``
branch of your remote repository.


6. Read the docs!
